	<p>We will use your information to provide and personalise our service. We will also use your contact details to communicate with you. We may use your information to send you offers and news about airline products and services or those of other carefully selected companies which we think may be
		of interest to you. We may contact you by post, email, telephone (including SMS) or fax for these purposes. Your confirmation e-mails (which may include details of flight bookings or other services booked through our websites) may include marketing material which we may feel will be of interest to
		you from other third parties.</p>

		maintenance and development, customer surveys, customer relations and to help us in any future dealings with you, for example by identifying your requirements and preferences.</p>

	<p>We like to receive feedback from our customers to help us improve our service. We may contact you by post, e-mail, telephone or fax to ask your opinions.</p>
