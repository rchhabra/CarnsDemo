				<p>The countdown to your break away has really started now – it’s nearly time for your trip! So here are a few last minute checks.</p>
				<p>We recommend arriving 2 hours before your flight to give yourself time to get through the airport. The boarding gate closes 30 minutes before departure.</p>
				<p>You can bring ONE cabin bag up to a maximum size of 56 x 45 x 25cm which must be placed in the overhead locker. Overhead locker space is limited, so on busy flights this may have to go into the hold. There are no weight restrictions on your cabin bag.</p>
				<p>If you’ve only got a cabin bag, once you've checked in online and printed your boarding pass, you can head to security. Just make sure any liquids you are bringing with you are 100ml or less and stored in a transparent resealable bag measuring less than 20 x 20cm.</p>
